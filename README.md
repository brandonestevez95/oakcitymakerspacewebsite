### Oak City Makerspace Website

The Oak City Makerspace aims to revolutionize STEM education by offering immersive and hands-on learning experiences for children through mobile workshops featuring tinkering toys, circuits, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. To support this innovative business model and reach a wider audience, I want to develop a dynamic and user-friendly website using Python and Flask.

## What my website will include:

[x] Information Hub: The website will serve as a central hub for parents, educators, and organizations to learn about Oak City Makerspace's offerings, including workshop packages, educational resources, and upcoming events.

[x] Online Booking: Integrated booking functionality will allow users to conveniently schedule workshops, birthday parties, and other events directly through the website, streamlining the booking process and maximizing accessibility.

[x] Educational Content: The website will feature educational content, tutorials, and project ideas related to tinkering toys, circuits, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi, providing valuable resources for children, parents, and educators interested in STEM learning.

[x] Community Engagement: Interactive features such as discussion forums, photo galleries, and success stories will foster a sense of community among users, encouraging collaboration, sharing, and networking within the Oak City Makerspace community.

## What my project will include:

[x] Python and Flask: Leveraging the power and flexibility of Python and Flask, we will develop a robust and scalable web application tailored to the specific needs of Oak City Makerspace.
[x] Responsive Design: The website will be designed with responsive layout and mobile compatibility in mind, ensuring optimal viewing and usability across devices and screen sizes.
[x] Database Integration: We will implement a database backend to store user data, workshop schedules, and content management, enabling seamless data management and retrieval for administrators and users alike.

In closing, by developing a Python-based website for Oak City Makerspace, I aim to enhance accessibility, engagement, and effectiveness in delivering STEM education to children across Raleigh.
